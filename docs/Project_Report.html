    <h1>3. SYSTEM ANALYSIS</h1>
    
    <h2>3.1. IDENTIFICATION OF NEED</h2>
    
    <p>The identification of need for a Hospital Management System emerged from comprehensive analysis of current healthcare facility operations and the challenges they face. This section documents the systematic process of identifying and validating the need for this system.</p>
    
    <h3>3.1.1 Current System Analysis</h3>
    
    <p>Most healthcare facilities currently operate using a combination of manual processes and fragmented digital systems. The analysis revealed several critical issues:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Manual Record Management:</strong> Patient records are often maintained in physical files, making them difficult to search, update, and share. This leads to delays in accessing critical information during emergencies and increases the risk of data loss or damage.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Disconnected Systems:</strong> Different departments often use separate systems that don't communicate with each other. For example, the billing department may use one system while the appointment scheduling uses another, requiring manual data transfer and increasing the likelihood of errors.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Inefficient Appointment Scheduling:</strong> Appointment booking is typically done manually, leading to double-booking, scheduling conflicts, and poor utilization of doctor availability. Patients often experience long waiting times due to inefficient scheduling.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Billing Inefficiencies:</strong> Manual billing processes are time-consuming and error-prone. Calculation errors, delayed bill generation, and difficulty in tracking payments result in revenue loss and patient dissatisfaction.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Limited Reporting Capabilities:</strong> Without integrated data systems, generating reports requires manual data compilation from multiple sources, making it difficult to obtain timely insights for decision-making.</p>
    
    <h3>3.1.2 Stakeholder Needs Assessment</h3>
    
    <p>Through interviews and surveys with various stakeholders, the following needs were identified:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Administrators:</strong> Need comprehensive oversight of hospital operations, financial reporting, staff management, and system configuration capabilities. They require real-time analytics to make informed decisions about resource allocation and operational improvements.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Doctors:</strong> Need easy access to patient medical history, efficient appointment management, and tools to record diagnoses and treatments. They require a system that saves time and allows them to focus on patient care rather than administrative tasks.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Nurses:</strong> Need access to patient information, appointment schedules, and the ability to update patient records. They require a user-friendly interface that allows quick access to critical information.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Receptionists:</strong> Need efficient tools for patient registration, appointment booking, and basic information retrieval. They require a system that reduces paperwork and speeds up patient check-in processes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Patients:</strong> Need quick appointment booking, easy access to their medical records, transparent billing, and reduced waiting times. They expect a modern, efficient healthcare experience.</p>

    <h4>3.8.2.1 Activity Flow Description</h4>
    
    <p>The appointment booking process begins when a user logs into the system. The user selects a patient, then chooses a doctor and preferred date/time. The system checks doctor availability. If available, the appointment is created and notifications are sent. If not available, the system displays an error and suggests alternative time slots.</p>
