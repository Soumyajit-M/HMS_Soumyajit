    <h1>CHAPTER 1</h1>
    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>The healthcare industry represents one of the most critical sectors globally, directly impacting human lives, well-being, and societal productivity. Efficient management of healthcare facilities, particularly hospitals, requires sophisticated systems that can handle complex workflows involving patient care, medical personnel coordination, resource allocation, financial transactions, and regulatory compliance. Traditional manual and paper-based hospital management approaches suffer from inefficiencies, human errors, data redundancy, delayed access to critical information, and difficulty in maintaining comprehensive patient histories.</p>
    
    <p>In the contemporary digital age, healthcare information technology has emerged as a transformative force, enabling hospitals to streamline operations, improve patient outcomes, reduce administrative overhead, and make data-driven decisions. Electronic Health Records (EHR), computerized appointment scheduling, automated billing systems, digital inventory management, and analytics-driven insights have become essential components of modern healthcare delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of digital healthcare solutions, highlighting the necessity for robust, scalable, and accessible hospital management systems that can adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.</p>
    
    <p>The Hospital Management System (HMS) developed as part of this project represents a comprehensive, web-based solution designed to address the multifaceted challenges faced by healthcare facilities. This system integrates patient management, doctor coordination, appointment scheduling, billing and payment processing, inventory tracking, laboratory test management, insurance claims, staff scheduling, room allocation, telemedicine capabilities, and extensive reporting functionalities into a unified platform. Built using modern web technologies including PHP 8.2.12, SQLite database, Bootstrap 5.3.0 frontend framework, Chart.js for data visualization, and JavaScript for interactive features, the system demonstrates practical application of software engineering principles, database design, and user experience considerations.</p>
    
    <p>The development approach followed the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology, encompassing requirements gathering through stakeholder interviews and process analysis, comprehensive system design including database normalization and class modeling, iterative implementation with modular architecture, rigorous testing at multiple levels, and continuous refinement based on user feedback. The resulting system comprises 18 core PHP classes managing distinct functional areas, over 22,000 lines of code across 135 files, and a well-structured SQLite database with 15 tables implementing proper referential integrity constraints.</p>

    <p>This report documents the complete project lifecycle, from initial problem identification and requirements analysis through design, implementation, testing, security implementation, cost estimation, and future enhancement opportunities.

<div class="page">
    <h2>1.1 Background</h2>
    
    <p>Healthcare facilities worldwide face mounting pressure to deliver high-quality patient care while managing operational costs, regulatory compliance requirements, and increasing patient volumes. Small to medium-sized hospitals and clinics often struggle with limited IT budgets, making expensive proprietary Hospital Information Systems (HIS) financially unfeasible. This creates a significant digital divide where smaller healthcare providers continue relying on manual processes, spreadsheets, and disconnected software applications, leading to fragmented data, inefficient workflows, and compromised patient care quality.</p>
    
    <p>The Indian healthcare sector, in particular, has witnessed rapid growth with increasing healthcare awareness, rising health insurance penetration, and government initiatives promoting digital health records. However, many tier-2 and tier-3 city hospitals, nursing homes, and specialized clinics lack affordable, customizable, and easy-to-deploy management systems. Market research conducted during the preliminary investigation phase revealed that existing solutions either offer limited functionality at low price points or provide comprehensive features but require substantial upfront investment and ongoing licensing fees that strain operational budgets.</p>
    
    <p>This gap in the market presents an opportunity for developing accessible, open-source or affordable hospital management solutions tailored to the specific needs of small and medium healthcare facilities. Such systems must balance comprehensive functionality with simplicity, ensuring that medical staff with varying levels of technical proficiency can efficiently utilize the platform. Additionally, the system must accommodate local requirements such as multi-currency support for international patients, integration with government health schemes, and adaptability to different specializations and hospital sizes.</p>
    
    <p>From a technical perspective, advancements in web development frameworks, database technologies, cloud computing, and responsive design have made it feasible to develop sophisticated healthcare management systems using open-source technologies. PHP remains one of the most widely deployed server-side programming languages, with extensive community support, mature frameworks, and proven scalability. SQLite offers a lightweight, file-based database solution ideal for applications requiring moderate concurrency without the complexity of client-server database management systems. Bootstrap provides responsive, mobile-friendly user interface components that ensure consistent user experience across devices. Chart.js enables rich data visualizations that transform raw healthcare data into actionable insights.</p>
    
    <p>The convergence of these technologies, combined with a clear understanding of healthcare workflows and operational requirements, forms the foundation for developing this Hospital Management System. The project aims to demonstrate that comprehensive, production-quality healthcare management solutions can be developed using freely available tools and frameworks, making advanced hospital automation accessible to a broader range of healthcare providers.</p>

<div class="page">
    <h2>1.2 Problem Statement</h2>
    
    <p>Small and medium-sized hospitals and healthcare facilities face significant operational challenges stemming from the absence of integrated management systems. These challenges manifest across multiple dimensions:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Patient Management Inefficiencies:</strong> Manual patient registration processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and result in duplicate records. Physical file management systems make it difficult to quickly retrieve patient histories during emergencies. Incomplete or illegible handwritten medical records compromise care quality. The absence of centralized patient databases prevents physicians from accessing comprehensive medical histories, allergies, and treatment contraindications, increasing the risk of adverse drug reactions and medical errors.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Appointment Scheduling Conflicts:</strong> Manual appointment booking using registers or basic spreadsheets frequently results in double-booking, scheduling conflicts, and inefficient utilization of physician time. Patients experience long wait times due to poor schedule optimization. The inability to send automated appointment reminders leads to high no-show rates, wasting valuable consultation slots. Healthcare providers lack visibility into appointment patterns and physician workload distribution, making resource planning difficult.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Billing and Revenue Leakage:</strong> Manual billing processes are susceptible to calculation errors, missing charges for services rendered, and delays in generating invoices. The complexity of tracking multiple payment methods, partial payments, insurance claims, and outstanding balances manually results in revenue leakage. The absence of comprehensive financial reporting makes it challenging to identify revenue trends, monitor outstanding receivables, and make informed financial decisions. Currency conversion errors occur when serving international patients, leading to financial discrepancies.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Inventory Management Problems:</strong> Manual tracking of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment leads to stockouts of critical items or excessive inventory carrying costs. Expired medications go unnoticed until discovered during audits, representing financial losses and potential patient safety risks. The inability to track supplier performance, item usage patterns, and reorder points results in reactive rather than proactive procurement strategies.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Communication and Coordination Gaps:</strong> Lack of integrated communication systems between departments results in delays in test results, medication administration, and patient transfers. Emergency situations require rapid access to patient information, which manual systems cannot efficiently provide. The absence of automated notifications means staff rely on verbal communication, increasing the likelihood of miscommunication and missed critical information.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Reporting and Analytics Limitations:</strong> Manual compilation of reports for regulatory compliance, performance analysis, and decision-making is labor-intensive and time-consuming. The inability to visualize trends in patient volumes, disease patterns, treatment outcomes, and financial metrics hampers strategic planning. Healthcare administrators lack data-driven insights for resource allocation, staff scheduling, and capacity planning.</p>

Intelligent Appointment Scheduling System:</strong> Implement an automated appointment booking system that prevents scheduling conflicts, optimizes physician time utilization, sends automated reminders to reduce no-show rates, and provides real-time visibility into appointment status. The system must enforce doctor availability constraints based on configured schedules, support multiple appointment types (consultation, follow-up, emergency), enable appointment rescheduling and cancellation with proper status tracking, and generate daily appointment reports for each physician. The Appointment.php class manages this functionality with conflict detection algorithms and status workflow management.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Comprehensive Billing and Payment Processing:</strong> Create a flexible billing module supporting itemized invoicing, multiple payment methods (cash, card, bank transfer, insurance), partial payment tracking, multi-currency support for international patients, automated calculation of balances and due dates, and generation of payment receipts and outstanding balance reports. The system must integrate billing with appointment and treatment records, support insurance claim generation, and provide detailed financial analytics. This is implemented through Billing.php, AutoBilling.php, and Currency.php classes working with billing, billing_items, and payments tables.</p>
    
    <p><strong>4. Efficient Inventory and Stock Management:</strong> Develop an inventory management module tracking medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment with features including stock level monitoring with low-stock alerts, expiry date tracking with automated notifications, supplier management and procurement history, item categorization and search capabilities, usage pattern analytics, and integration with billing for automatic inventory deduction upon supply dispensation. The Inventory.php class manages these operations with the inventory database table.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 2: OBJECTIVE - PAGE 7 -->
<div class="page">
    <p><strong>5. Role-Based Access Control and Security:</strong> Implement a robust authentication and authorization system supporting multiple user roles (admin, doctor, nurse, receptionist, pharmacist) with granular permissions controlling access to features and data based on job responsibilities. The system must enforce secure password policies with hashing, implement session management preventing unauthorized access, provide audit trails for critical operations, and support user account management with enable/disable capabilities. The Auth.php class implements these security measures using bcrypt password hashing and session-based authentication.</p>
    
    <p><strong>6. Comprehensive Reporting and Analytics:</strong> Create a reporting module generating insights across patient demographics, appointment statistics, revenue and financial performance, inventory consumption patterns, doctor workload and productivity, and departmental performance metrics. Reports must be available in both on-screen and PDF formats, support date range filtering, and provide visual representations using charts and graphs. The Report.php, PDFReport.php, and Dashboard.php classes utilize Chart.js for data visualization.</p>
    
    <p><strong>7. Doctor and Staff Management:</strong> Develop modules for managing physician profiles including specializations, qualifications, consultation fees, availability schedules, and performance metrics. The system must support staff scheduling, workload distribution, and integration with appointment booking to display doctor availability in real-time. Doctor.php, Staff.php, and Schedule.php classes manage these requirements.</p>
    
    <p><strong>8. Data Integrity and Reliability:</strong> Ensure database design follows normalization principles to eliminate redundancy and maintain consistency, implement referential integrity constraints using foreign keys, provide transaction support for critical operations to maintain ACID properties, implement regular backup mechanisms, and include data validation at both frontend and backend layers. This is achieved through proper SQLite database schema design with CHECK constraints, FOREIGN KEY relationships, and the Validation.php class for business rule enforcement.</p>
    
    <h2>2.2 Secondary Objectives</h2>
    
    <p>Secondary objectives enhance the system's value proposition beyond core functional requirements, providing competitive advantages and improved user experience. While not absolutely essential for basic system operation, these objectives significantly increase system utility and adoption.</p>

Multi-Currency Support:</strong> Implement comprehensive multi-currency functionality supporting nine major currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, INR, JPY, AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY) with configurable default currency, automatic currency symbol display throughout the application, and consistent formatting of monetary values. The Currency.php class provides this capability, enabling the hospital to serve international patients and maintain financial records in preferred currencies.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2. Telemedicine Capabilities:</strong> Develop telemedicine features enabling remote consultations, particularly valuable during pandemic situations or for follow-up appointments that don't require physical examination. This includes appointment types specifically for virtual consultations, integration points for video conferencing platforms, and digital prescription generation. The Telemedicine.php class lays the groundwork for these features.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3. Laboratory Test Management:</strong> Create a laboratory module for ordering tests, recording results, integrating test charges with billing, and generating test result reports. The Laboratory.php class manages test catalogs, patient test orders, result entry, and report generation, providing end-to-end laboratory workflow support.</p>
    
    <div class="page-number">7</div>

    <h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
    <h1>SYSTEM ANALYSIS</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>System analysis is a systematic approach to identifying problems, opportunities, and objectives, determining information requirements, and recommending a course of action to improve a system. This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the Hospital Management System project, documenting the journey from initial concept to detailed technical specification. It encompasses the identification of needs through stakeholder engagement, preliminary investigation of the problem domain, a thorough feasibility study, project planning and scheduling, and the formal specification of software and system requirements. This structured analysis ensures that the final system is well-aligned with user needs, technically viable, and provides a clear return on investment.</p>
    
    <h2>3.1 Identification of Need</h2>
    
    <p>The need for an integrated Hospital Management System was identified through a combination of direct observation, stakeholder interviews, and analysis of existing manual processes at several small to medium-sized healthcare facilities. The current state of operations in these facilities revealed significant inefficiencies and challenges that directly impact patient care quality, operational costs, and staff productivity.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Key Observations and Findings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fragmented Data Silos:</strong> Patient information was scattered across multiple physical registers, including registration logs, appointment diaries, billing ledgers, and individual patient files. This fragmentation made it extremely difficult to get a holistic view of a patient's medical history, leading to redundant data entry and potential for errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Appointment Scheduling:</strong> Receptionists managed appointments using paper-based diaries. This process was prone to human error, such as double-booking, and offered no easy way to track doctor availability or send reminders to patients, resulting in high no-show rates and underutilized consultation slots.</li>
        <li><strong>Error-Prone Billing Processes:</strong> Billing was conducted manually, with staff calculating charges for services, consultations, and medications by hand. This led to frequent calculation errors, missed charges for services rendered (revenue leakage), and significant delays in generating final invoices, causing patient dissatisfaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Inefficient Inventory Management:</strong> Medical supplies and pharmaceuticals were tracked using basic stock registers or spreadsheets. This reactive approach provided no alerts for low stock levels or expiring items, leading to stockouts of critical supplies and financial losses from expired inventory.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Data for Decision-Making:</strong> Hospital administrators lacked access to real-time data on key performance indicators such as patient volume, bed occupancy rates, revenue trends, and operational costs. All reports were compiled manually, a process that was both time-consuming and often produced outdated information.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These observations clearly indicated a pressing need for a centralized, automated system that could integrate these disparate functions into a single, cohesive platform. The proposed HMS aims to digitize these workflows, providing a single source of truth for all hospital data and automating routine administrative tasks to allow medical staff to focus more on patient care.</p>

    <p>The development of the Hospital Management System followed a structured System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), as depicted in Figure 3.1. An iterative waterfall model was adopted, allowing for a sequential progression through the phases of analysis, design, implementation, and testing, with feedback loops between phases to accommodate refinements. This approach provided the structure of the traditional waterfall model while allowing for the flexibility to revisit and improve upon earlier stages as the project evolved.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Gap Analysis:</strong> A formal gap analysis was conducted to quantify the difference between the current state of manual operations and the desired future state with the implemented HMS. The analysis highlighted critical gaps in efficiency, data accuracy, patient experience, and financial management. Table 3.1 summarizes the key findings of this analysis, providing a clear justification for the development of the proposed system. The features of the HMS were designed specifically to bridge these identified gaps.</p>

    <h2>3.2 Preliminary Investigation</h2>
    
    <p>Following the identification of need, a preliminary investigation was conducted to understand the problem domain in greater depth, define the project's boundaries, and assess the initial feasibility. This phase involved gathering information from various sources to build a strong business case for the project.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Information Gathering Techniques:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> Conducted structured interviews with key stakeholders, including hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, receptionists, and pharmacists. These interviews helped in understanding their day-to-day tasks, challenges, and expectations from a new system. For example, doctors emphasized the need for quick access to patient history, while receptionists highlighted the difficulties in managing appointment schedules.</li>
        <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Directly observed the workflow in different departments of a local clinic. This provided firsthand insight into the real-world processes, bottlenecks, and workarounds currently in place. Observing the patient journey from registration to checkout was particularly insightful for mapping the required system workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Review of Existing Documentation:</strong> Analyzed existing paper forms, registers, and reports used in the hospital. This helped in defining the data requirements for the new system, such as the fields needed for patient registration, billing, and medical records.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Research:</strong> Investigated existing Hospital Management Systems available on the market. This analysis of competing products helped in identifying standard features, potential gaps in the market for small-scale hospitals, and establishing a baseline for the proposed system's functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Stakeholder Analysis:</strong> A crucial part of the investigation was identifying and analyzing the stakeholders who would be affected by the system. Understanding their roles, interests, and influence was vital for gathering comprehensive requirements and ensuring user adoption. Figure 3.2 illustrates the primary stakeholders and their key interests in the HMS project. This analysis confirmed that the system needed to cater to a diverse set of users with different responsibilities and technical skills.</p>
    
    <p>The preliminary investigation concluded that a web-based system built with open-source technologies would be the most effective solution. It would offer centralized access, lower deployment costs compared to proprietary systems, and could be customized to meet the specific needs of small to medium-sized hospitals. The findings from this phase provided the necessary inputs for the detailed feasibility study that followed.</p>

        <li><strong>Receptionists:</strong> Need a user-friendly interface for managing patient registration and appointments, handling inquiries, and processing payments efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Pharmacists:</strong> Need an integrated system to manage medication inventory, view prescriptions, and track dispensation.</li>
        <li><strong>Hospital Administrators:</strong> Focused on operational efficiency, financial performance, resource optimization, and access to comprehensive reports for strategic planning and regulatory compliance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Balancing these varied interests was a key challenge addressed during the system design phase. The goal was to create a unified system that provides value to all stakeholders, thereby ensuring its successful adoption and integration into the hospital's daily operations.</p>

    <h2>3.3 Feasibility Study</h2>
    
    <p>A feasibility study is a critical analysis that evaluates the viability of a proposed project. It assesses whether the project is technically possible, operationally practical, and economically justifiable. For the Hospital Management System, the feasibility was examined from three key perspectives: technical, operational, and economic.</p>
    
    <h3>3.3.1 Technical Feasibility</h3>
    
    <p>Technical feasibility assesses the availability of the required technology, tools, and technical expertise to develop the system. The evaluation focused on whether the proposed technology stack was adequate and if the development team possessed the necessary skills to complete the project successfully.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Technology and Tools Assessment:</strong> The project proposed using a stack of mature, widely-used, and well-documented open-source technologies. This choice significantly mitigated technical risks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PHP 8.2.12:</strong> A modern, robust server-side scripting language with strong object-oriented capabilities, a vast ecosystem of libraries, and extensive community support. Its suitability for web application development is well-established.</li>
        <li><strong>SQLite 3:</strong> A lightweight, serverless, self-contained, transactional SQL database engine. It is ideal for small to medium-scale applications, requires zero configuration, and is highly reliable. Its file-based nature simplifies deployment and backup procedures.</li>
        <li><strong>Bootstrap 5.3.0:</strong> A leading front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It provides a comprehensive library of pre-styled components, a powerful grid system, and JavaScript plugins, accelerating UI development.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript (ES6+):</strong> The standard language for client-side interactivity. Used for form validation, asynchronous communication with the server (AJAX), and dynamic content updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Chart.js:</strong> A simple yet flexible JavaScript library for creating animated and interactive charts and graphs, perfect for the reporting and dashboard module.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The chosen technologies are all stable, well-documented, and do not require any special licensing or hardware, making them a low-risk choice. The hardware requirements for both the development and deployment environments are modest and easily met by standard modern computers and web servers, as detailed in Table 3.2.</p>

    <h3>3.3.2 Operational Feasibility</h3>
    
    <p>Operational feasibility assesses how well the proposed system will be accepted and used by the end-users and how it fits into the existing organizational structure and workflows. It is concerned with the human and organizational aspects of the project.</p>
    
    <p><strong>User Acceptance:</strong> The success of the HMS heavily depends on its acceptance by the hospital staff. The preliminary investigation revealed that while the staff was frustrated with the manual system, there was also some apprehension about adopting a new, complex technology. To address this, the following strategies were incorporated into the project plan:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Centric Design:</strong> The user interface was designed to be intuitive, clean, and easy to navigate. The goal was to minimize the learning curve and ensure that users with basic computer skills could perform their tasks with minimal training.</li>
        <li><strong>Stakeholder Involvement:</strong> Key users (a doctor, a nurse, and a receptionist) were involved during the design and testing phases. Their feedback was actively sought and incorporated to ensure the system met their practical needs and fit into their daily routines.</li>
        <li><strong>Training and Documentation:</strong> A plan for providing user training and clear, concise user documentation was considered. Although full implementation of a training program is outside the academic scope, the system was designed with this requirement in mind, featuring helpful tooltips and clear labeling.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Workflow Integration:</strong> The system was designed to mirror and improve upon existing workflows rather than completely overhauling them. For example, the digital patient registration form captures the same information as the old paper form but adds automated validation and data storage. This approach helps in a smoother transition and reduces resistance to change.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Organizational Impact:</strong> The introduction of the HMS is expected to have a positive impact on the organization. It will automate many repetitive administrative tasks, freeing up staff to focus on more value-added activities, such as patient care. It will improve inter-departmental communication by providing a shared data platform. While some job roles might evolve (e.g., from manual record-keeping to data entry and system monitoring), the system is intended to augment staff capabilities, not replace them. Table 3.4 provides an assessment of the operational impact on different user roles.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Conclusion on Operational Feasibility:</strong> The project was deemed operationally feasible. By focusing on user-centric design, involving stakeholders, and planning for a smooth integration with existing workflows, the risks of user resistance and operational disruption were minimized. The system is expected to be well-received as it directly addresses the daily frustrations of the staff and offers clear benefits in terms of efficiency and job satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>3.3.3 Economic Feasibility</h3>
    
    <p>Economic feasibility, also known as a cost-benefit analysis, determines if the financial benefits of the project outweigh the costs. For this academic project, the analysis is illustrative, based on estimated costs and benefits for a small clinic adopting such a system.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Cost Analysis:</strong> The costs associated with the project can be categorized into one-time development costs and recurring operational costs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Development Costs:</strong> Since this is an academic project developed by a student, the primary cost is the time and effort invested. However, in a commercial scenario, this would include salaries for developers, project managers, and testers. For this analysis, we can estimate the development effort.
            <ul>
                <li>Estimated Effort: 480 hours (e.g., 20 hours/week for 6 months).</li>
                <li>Illustrative Cost: At a hypothetical student/intern rate of $20/hour, the development cost would be <strong>$9,600</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure & Deployment Costs:</strong> These are the costs to host and run the application.
            <ul>
                <li>Hardware: The system can run on a basic cloud server. Estimated annual cost: <strong>$120</strong> (e.g., $10/month for a basic VPS).</li>
                <li>Software: All software used (PHP, SQLite, Apache) is open-source and free, so software licensing cost is <strong>$0</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance Costs:</strong> This includes ongoing support, bug fixes, and minor updates.
            <ul>
                <li>Estimated annual effort: 40 hours. At $20/hour, this is <strong>$800</strong> per year.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Benefit Analysis:</strong> The benefits can be tangible (quantifiable in monetary terms) and intangible (difficult to quantify but still valuable).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tangible Benefits:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Revenue Leakage:</strong> Automating billing could prevent missed charges, potentially increasing revenue by 2-3%. For a clinic with $200,000 annual revenue, this is <strong>$4,000 - $6,000</strong> per year.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Efficiency:</strong> Automating administrative tasks could save staff time. If the system saves 10 hours of administrative work per week at an average staff cost of $15/hour, the annual saving is 10 * 52 * $15 = <strong>$7,800</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced No-Show Rate:</strong> Automated reminders can reduce appointment no-shows. If this recovers just 2 appointments per week at an average consultation fee of $50, the annual revenue gain is 2 * 52 * $50 = <strong>$5,200</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Intangible Benefits:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved patient care and safety due to better access to information.</li>
                <li>Enhanced patient satisfaction and loyalty.</li>
                <li>Improved staff morale and job satisfaction.</li>
                <li>Better data for strategic decision-making and compliance.</li>
                <li>Enhanced professional image of the hospital.</li>

    <h2>3.4 Project Planning</h2>
    
    <p>Effective project planning is fundamental to ensuring that a project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. The planning for the Hospital Management System project involved defining the project scope, identifying tasks, estimating effort, and allocating resources. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) was created to deconstruct the project into smaller, manageable components.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):</strong> The project was broken down into the following major phases and tasks:</p>

    <p><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Potential risks were identified during the planning phase, along with mitigation strategies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk: Scope Creep.</strong> Uncontrolled addition of new features.
            <ul><li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> A clearly defined scope document (Section 2.3). Any new feature requests were evaluated against the project objectives and timeline, and deferred to "Future Scope" if not critical.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Risk: Technical Challenges.</strong> Encountering unforeseen programming or integration issues.
            <ul><li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Chose a mature and well-documented technology stack. Allocated time in the schedule for research and problem-solving. Leveraged community forums and documentation.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Risk: Time Slippage.</strong> Tasks taking longer than estimated.
            <ul><li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Broke down the project into small, manageable tasks. Tracked progress regularly against the schedule (Gantt chart) and re-prioritized tasks if necessary. Built in a small buffer in the schedule for unforeseen delays.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Risk: Lack of Stakeholder Availability.</strong> Difficulty in getting feedback from busy hospital staff.
            <ul><li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Scheduled short, focused feedback sessions well in advance. Prepared specific questions and prototypes to make the most of their time.</li></ul>

    <h2>3.5 Project Scheduling</h2>
    
    <p>Project scheduling involves creating a timeline for the completion of all project tasks and milestones. It is a critical tool for managing time, allocating resources, and tracking progress. For the Hospital Management System project, two primary scheduling tools were used: the Gantt chart and the PERT chart.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Gantt Chart:</strong> A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. It lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis and the time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each task. Gantt charts are excellent for visualizing the project timeline, task dependencies, and progress over time.</p>
    
    <p>Figure 3.5 shows the Gantt chart for the HMS project. It breaks down the project into the major phases defined in the WBS and maps them onto a 26-week timeline. Key aspects illustrated by the Gantt chart include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task Durations:</strong> The length of each bar represents the estimated time to complete a task. For example, "System Design" is scheduled for 4 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Task Dependencies:</strong> The chart shows how tasks are sequenced. For instance, "Implementation" cannot begin until "System Design" is complete. This is a key feature of the waterfall-like approach taken.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Tasks:</strong> Within a phase, some tasks could be performed in parallel. For example, during implementation, development of different backend modules could overlap to some extent.</li>
        <li><strong>Milestones:</strong> Key milestones, such as "Core Modules Implemented," are marked on the chart, providing clear checkpoints to assess progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> As the project progresses, the bars can be shaded to indicate the percentage of completion for each task, providing an immediate visual status report.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>PERT Chart:</strong> PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is another project management tool used to schedule, organize, and coordinate tasks within a project. Unlike a Gantt chart, which focuses on the timeline, a PERT chart emphasizes task dependencies and the critical path.</p>
    
    <p>A PERT chart represents tasks and milestones as nodes and the dependencies between them as arrows. It is particularly useful for identifying the critical path—the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the minimum time to complete the project. Any delay in a task on the critical path will delay the entire project.</p>
    
    <p>Figure 3.6 illustrates a simplified PERT chart for the HMS project. It helps in understanding the inter-relationships between tasks and highlights the sequence of activities that must be managed closely to ensure the project stays on schedule. For this project, the critical path runs through Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Documentation, as these phases are largely sequential.</p>
    
    <p>Together, the Gantt and PERT charts provided a robust framework for managing the project schedule, ensuring that all tasks were accounted for and that the project progressed in a logical and timely manner.</p>

            (e.g., A bar chart showing project phases/tasks on the Y-axis and a 26-week timeline on the X-axis. Each bar represents the duration and timing of a task.)

    </div>
    
    <p>The Gantt chart in Figure 3.5 provides a clear visual roadmap for the project. The 26-week timeline is broken down as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weeks 1-4: Analysis and Planning.</strong> This initial phase focused on understanding the requirements and establishing a solid plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Weeks 5-8: System Design.</strong> A dedicated month for architecting the system, designing the database, and creating the UI/UX mockups.</li>
        <li><strong>Weeks 9-20: Implementation.</strong> The longest phase, spanning 12 weeks, dedicated to coding the backend and frontend, and integrating them. This phase was further broken down into sprints focusing on specific modules.</li>
        <li><strong>Weeks 21-23: Testing.</strong> A 3-week period for rigorous testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Weeks 24-26: Documentation and Deployment.</strong> The final phase for writing the project report, preparing user documentation, and deploying the application.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This structured timeline allowed for regular progress reviews and ensured that each phase received adequate attention before moving to the next.</p>

        <p class="caption">Figure 3.6: PERT Chart - Critical Path</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The PERT chart in Figure 3.6 highlights the critical path for the project. The critical path is the sequence of stages determining the minimum time needed for the project. In this case, the path is:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Start → Analysis → Design → Implementation → Testing → Documentation → End</strong></p>
    <p>The total duration of the critical path is 26 weeks. This means that any delay in any of the tasks along this path would directly impact the project's final delivery date. For example, if the "System Design" phase took 5 weeks instead of the planned 4, the entire project would be delayed by one week, unless the time could be recovered in a subsequent phase (which is often difficult).</p>
    <p>Understanding the critical path allowed for focused management attention on these essential tasks to prevent delays. Tasks not on the critical path have "slack" or "float," meaning they can be delayed to some extent without affecting the project deadline. For instance, preparing a detailed user manual could have some slack as long as it is completed before the final submission.</p>

    <h3>3.6.2 Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
    
    <p>Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define the quality attributes of a system. They describe how the system should work, rather than what it should do. These are crucial for user satisfaction and the overall success of the system.</p>
    
    <p><strong>NFR-1: Performance</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The system should load any page within 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.</li>
        <li>Database queries for common searches (e.g., finding a patient) should return results in under 2 seconds.</li>
        <li>The system should support up to 50 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>NFR-2: Usability</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The user interface must be intuitive and easy to learn. A new user with basic computer skills should be able to perform common tasks (e.g., book an appointment) with less than 15 minutes of training.</li>
        <li>The system must be responsive and provide a consistent user experience across different devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).</li>
        <li>The system shall provide clear feedback to users for their actions (e.g., success messages, error notifications).</li>
        <li>All forms and inputs should have clear labels and validation messages.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>NFR-3: Reliability</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The system should have an uptime of at least 99.5%.</li>
        <li>The system must ensure data integrity. All database transactions (e.g., creating a bill and updating inventory) must be atomic.</li>
        <li>The system should handle errors gracefully and display user-friendly error messages without crashing.</li>
        <li>A mechanism for regular automated backups of the database must be in place to prevent data loss.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>NFR-4: Security</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The system must be protected against common web vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).</li>
        <li>All sensitive data, especially passwords, must be stored in an encrypted or hashed format.</li>
        <li>User sessions must be managed securely, with sessions timing out after a period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes).</li>
        <li>Access to different parts of the system must be strictly enforced based on user roles.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>NFR-5: Maintainability</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The source code must be well-documented, with comments explaining complex logic.</li>
        <li>The code must follow a consistent coding standard and a modular architecture (e.g., separating business logic, data access, and presentation).</li>
        <li>The system should be easy to update and modify. Adding a new module should not require significant changes to the core system.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>NFR-6: Scalability</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The system should be designed to handle a growing amount of data. The database schema should be optimized for performance even with millions of records.</li>
        <li>The application architecture should allow for horizontal scaling (adding more web servers) if user load increases significantly in the future.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3.7 System Specification</h2>
    
    <p>The system specification provides a detailed description of the hardware and software environment in which the Hospital Management System will operate. This section outlines the requirements for the server (where the application is hosted) and the client (the user's machine).</p>
    
    <p><strong>System Architecture:</strong> The HMS is designed as a classic three-tier client-server application:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Presentation Tier (Client):</strong> This is the user interface that runs in a standard web browser on the client's machine. It is built with HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It is responsible for displaying information to the user and capturing their input.</li>
        <li><strong>Logic Tier (Server):</strong> This is the application server where the core business logic resides. It is powered by a web server (like Apache) and the PHP runtime. It processes requests from the client, interacts with the database, and sends back responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Tier (Server):</strong> This is the database server that stores and manages all the application data. In this project, it is an SQLite database, which is embedded within the application server environment.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This architecture, depicted in Figure 3.7, separates concerns, making the system more modular, maintainable, and scalable. The client is decoupled from the data storage, and the business logic is centralized on the server.</p>

    <h2>3.8 Data Models</h2>
    
    <p>Data models are abstract representations that organize elements of data and standardize how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. For the Hospital Management System, several modeling techniques were used to visualize the system from different perspectives. These models were crucial during the design phase to ensure a clear and correct understanding of the system's structure and behavior before writing any code. The five key diagrams created are the Class Diagram, Activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram, and Use Case Diagram.</p>
    
    <h3>3.8.1 Class Diagram</h3>
    
    <p>A class diagram is a type of static structure diagram in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects. It provides the main building block for all object-oriented solutions.</p>
    
    <p>The class diagram for the HMS, shown in Figure 3.8, was fundamental to the backend design. It maps directly to the 18 PHP classes developed for the project. Key aspects of the diagram include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classes:</strong> Each box represents a class (e.g., `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`, `Billing`).</li>
        <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> The attributes (properties or variables) of each class are listed (e.g., the `Patient` class has `patient_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`).</li>
        <li><strong>Methods:</strong> The operations (methods or functions) that each class can perform are listed (e.g., the `Appointment` class has `schedule()`, `cancel()`, `updateStatus()`).</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> The lines connecting the classes show their relationships:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Association:</strong> A general relationship between classes (e.g., a `Doctor` is associated with multiple `Appointments`).</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregation/Composition:</strong> A "has-a" relationship (e.g., a `Billing` record is composed of multiple `BillingItem` records).</li>
                <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> An "is-a" relationship (e.g., `Admin`, `Doctor`, and `Receptionist` could inherit from a base `User` class).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This diagram served as a blueprint for the backend development, ensuring a modular, organized, and maintainable codebase that accurately reflects the real-world entities and their interactions within the hospital environment.</p>

    <h3>3.8.2 Activity Diagram</h3>
    
    <p>An activity diagram is a UML diagram that models the flow of control or flow of objects from one activity to another. It is used to describe the dynamic aspects of the system and is particularly useful for modeling business workflows. Activity diagrams are essentially advanced flowcharts.</p>
    
    <p>Figure 3.9 shows an activity diagram for a key workflow in the HMS: the patient registration and appointment booking process. The diagram illustrates the sequence of actions and decisions involved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start and End Points:</strong> The flow begins with a black circle (initial node) and ends with a circled black circle (final node).</li>
        <li><strong>Activities:</strong> Rounded rectangles represent actions performed by a user or the system (e.g., "Search for Patient," "Enter Patient Details," "Select Doctor and Time").</li>
        <li><strong>Decision Nodes:</strong> A diamond shape represents a decision point with multiple possible outcomes (e.g., "Is Patient New?"). Each outgoing path is labeled with a condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Forks and Joins:</strong> Horizontal or vertical bars can be used to show parallel activities (forks) and the point where they must all be completed before the flow continues (joins).</li>
        <li><strong>Swimlanes:</strong> The diagram can be partitioned into "swimlanes," which assign activities to the responsible actors (e.g., Receptionist, System, Patient). This clearly shows who does what.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This activity diagram was used to validate the workflow with stakeholders (like receptionists) to ensure it accurately reflected and improved upon the real-world process. It helped in identifying potential bottlenecks and streamlining the steps involved in handling a patient's visit.</p>

    <h3>3.8.3 Sequence Diagram</h3>
    
    <p>A sequence diagram is a UML interaction diagram that shows how objects interact with each other and the order in which those interactions occur. It is excellent for visualizing the step-by-step logic of a specific use case or the implementation of a method.</p>
    
    <p>Figure 3.10 illustrates a sequence diagram for the "Book Appointment" use case. It details the sequence of messages exchanged between different objects (or classes) to accomplish this task. Key elements of the diagram include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lifelines:</strong> Vertical dashed lines represent the existence of an object over time. The box at the top shows the object's class (e.g., `:Receptionist`, `:AppointmentPage`, `:AppointmentController`, `:Doctor`, `:Patient`).</li>
        <li><strong>Messages:</strong> Horizontal arrows represent messages sent from one object to another. A solid arrowhead indicates a synchronous call (the sender waits for a response), while an open arrowhead indicates an asynchronous message.
            <ul>
                <li>Example: The `:Receptionist` actor calls the `submitForm()` method on the `:AppointmentPage`.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Activation Bars:</strong> The narrow rectangles on the lifelines (also called focus of control) show the period during which an object is performing an action, either directly or through a subordinate procedure.</li>
        <li><strong>Return Messages:</strong> Dashed arrows show the return of a value from a method call.</li>
        <li><strong>Loops and Alternatives:</strong> Frames can be drawn around parts of the diagram to indicate loops (`loop`), alternatives (`alt`), or optional (`opt`) interactions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Sequence diagrams were invaluable for designing the interactions between the frontend (JavaScript), the backend controller (PHP), and the database models. They helped to clearly define the API endpoints and the logic within the controller methods, ensuring that all necessary data was passed and all required checks (like checking doctor availability) were performed in the correct order.</p>

    <h3>3.8.4 Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram</h3>
    
    <p>An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram is a data modeling technique that graphically illustrates the structure of a database. It shows the entities (tables) in a database and the relationships between them. The ER diagram is the primary blueprint for designing a relational database.</p>
    
    <p>The ER diagram for the HMS database, shown in Figure 3.11, was created before writing any SQL code. It was essential for planning the database schema and ensuring data integrity. The main components of the ER diagram are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Entities:</strong> Rectangles represent entities, which correspond to tables in the database (e.g., `Patients`, `Doctors`, `Appointments`).</li>
        <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Ovals represent attributes, which correspond to columns in the tables (e.g., `first_name`, `specialization`, `appointment_date`). The primary key attribute is usually underlined.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Diamond shapes represent the relationships between entities (e.g., a `Patient` "schedules" an `Appointment`).</li>
        <li><strong>Cardinality:</strong> The cardinality of a relationship specifies the number of instances of one entity that can be related to instances of another entity. It is represented using notations like:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One-to-One (1:1):</strong> A doctor might have one user account.</li>
                <li><strong>One-to-Many (1:N):</strong> A `Doctor` can have many `Appointments`. A `Patient` can have many `Appointments`.</li>
                <li><strong>Many-to-Many (M:N):</strong> In some cases, a many-to-many relationship (e.g., between `Doctors` and `Departments`) would be resolved into two one-to-many relationships with a linking table.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This diagram helped to define the 15 tables in the SQLite database, their columns, primary keys, and the foreign key relationships that enforce referential integrity. For example, the diagram clearly shows that the `appointments` table must have foreign keys referencing the `patients` and `doctors` tables, ensuring that an appointment cannot exist without a valid patient and doctor.</p>

    <h3>3.8.5 Use Case Diagram</h3>
    
    <p>A use case diagram is a UML behavior diagram that provides a high-level, graphical overview of the functionality of a system. It is used to capture the requirements of a system by showing the interactions between external users (actors) and the system itself (the use cases).</p>
    
    <p>The use case diagram for the HMS, shown in Figure 3.12, was one of the first diagrams created during the analysis phase. It was instrumental in defining the scope of the project and communicating the system's intended functionality to stakeholders. The key components are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Actors:</strong> Stick figures represent actors, which are roles played by users or external systems that interact with the system. In this project, the primary actors are the `Admin`, `Doctor`, `Receptionist`, `Nurse`, and `Pharmacist`.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Ovals represent use cases, which are specific functions or services that the system provides to an actor (e.g., "Manage Patients," "Schedule Appointments," "Generate Bills").</li>
        <li><strong>System Boundary:</strong> A rectangle is drawn around the use cases to indicate the scope of the system. Actors are outside the boundary.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Lines connect actors to the use cases they interact with. The diagram can also show relationships between use cases:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;:</strong> Indicates that one use case's behavior is included in another. For example, "Schedule Appointment" might include "Check Doctor Availability."</li>
                <li><strong>&lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt;:</strong> Indicates that one use case provides optional, additional functionality to another. For example, "Generate Bill" could be extended by "Apply Discount."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This diagram provided a clear, high-level map of the system's features and which user roles are authorized to perform them. It served as a foundation for developing more detailed diagrams like activity and sequence diagrams for each use case.</p>

    <h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
    <h1>SYSTEM DESIGN</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is the phase that bridges the gap between the "what" (the requirements defined in the system analysis) and the "how" (the actual implementation). This chapter details the design of the Hospital Management System, focusing on the modular architecture, database design, user interface design, and data integrity measures.</p>
    
    <h2>4.1 Modularization Details</h2>
    
    <p>A modular design approach was adopted to manage the complexity of the system and enhance its maintainability and scalability. The system was broken down into a series of distinct, loosely coupled modules, each responsible for a specific area of functionality. In the object-oriented paradigm of this project, these modules are primarily represented by the PHP classes.</p>
    
    <p>The system is built around 18 core PHP classes, each residing in the `classes/` directory. This separation of concerns ensures that changes to one module have minimal impact on others. For example, modifying the billing logic in `Billing.php` does not require any changes to the patient management logic in `Patient.php`.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Core System Modules (Classes):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>`Auth.php`:</strong> Handles all aspects of user authentication and authorization. It manages user login, logout, session management, password hashing (bcrypt), and role-based access control.</li>
        <li><strong>`Patient.php`:</strong> Manages all patient-related data and operations, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of patient records.</li>
        <li><strong>`Doctor.php`:</strong> Manages doctor profiles, including their specializations, schedules, and other professional details.</li>
        <li><strong>`Appointment.php`:</strong> Contains the business logic for scheduling, viewing, updating, and canceling appointments. It includes logic to prevent scheduling conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>`Billing.php`:</strong> Responsible for creating and managing patient bills. It calculates total amounts, tracks payment status, and generates bill numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>`AutoBilling.php`:</strong> A specialized class to handle automated billing tasks, such as adding consultation fees to a bill when an appointment is completed.</li>
        <li><strong>`Currency.php`:</strong> A utility class to handle all currency-related formatting and conversions, ensuring consistent display of monetary values throughout the application.</li>
        <li><strong>`Dashboard.php`:</strong> Gathers and processes data for display on the main dashboard, providing key performance indicators (KPIs).</li>
        <li><strong>`Inventory.php`:</strong> Manages the hospital's inventory of medicines and supplies, including stock tracking, expiry alerts, and supplier information.</li>
        <li><strong>`Report.php` & `PDFReport.php`:</strong> These classes work together to generate various system reports. `Report.php` fetches the data, and `PDFReport.php` (likely using a library like FPDF or TCPDF) formats it into a downloadable PDF.</li>
        <li><strong>`Validation.php`:</strong> A helper class that provides common data validation rules (e.g., for emails, phone numbers, required fields), ensuring data quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Other specialized classes</strong> like `Laboratory.php`, `Insurance.php`, `Room.php`, `Schedule.php`, `Staff.php`, and `Telemedicine.php` handle their respective domains.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Figure 4.1 illustrates how these modules interact. The flow is typically initiated by a user action on a UI page (e.g., `patients.php`), which sends a request to a corresponding API endpoint (e.g., `api/patients.php`). The API endpoint then instantiates the necessary class (e.g., `Patient.php`) to perform the business logic and interact with the database.</p>

    <h2>4.2 Database Design</h2>
    
    <p>The database is the heart of the Hospital Management System, serving as the central repository for all data. The design of the database was guided by the ER diagram (Figure 3.11) and focused on achieving normalization, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing for performance.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Schema Design:</strong> The database schema consists of 15 tables, each designed to store information about a specific entity (e.g., patients, doctors, appointments). The full schema is provided in the Appendix.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Normalization:</strong> The database was designed following the principles of normalization to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>First Normal Form (1NF):</strong> Ensured by making sure that all table columns hold atomic values (not lists or sets) and each record is unique, which is achieved by having a primary key for every table.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Normal Form (2NF):</strong> Achieved by ensuring that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key. This is addressed by breaking down entities into separate tables. For example, patient details are in the `patients` table and appointment details are in the `appointments` table, linked by `patient_id`.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Normal Form (3NF):</strong> Achieved by removing transitive dependencies. For example, a doctor's specialization is stored in the `doctors` table, not in the `appointments` table. This prevents redundancy and update anomalies.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Data Integrity and Constraints:</strong> Several mechanisms were used to enforce data integrity at the database level:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Keys:</strong> Each table has a primary key (usually an auto-incrementing integer `id`) to uniquely identify each record.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign Keys:</strong> Foreign key constraints are used extensively to enforce referential integrity between tables. For example, the `appointments.patient_id` is a foreign key that references `patients.id`. This ensures that an appointment cannot be created for a non-existent patient. The `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause is used where appropriate, so that deleting a primary record (e.g., a patient) automatically deletes all related dependent records (e.g., their appointments).</li>
        <li><strong>UNIQUE Constraints:</strong> Used to ensure that values in a column or a group of columns are unique across all rows. For example, `users.username` and `patients.patient_id` have UNIQUE constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>NOT NULL Constraints:</strong> Applied to essential columns (e.g., `patients.first_name`, `appointments.appointment_date`) to ensure that no record is created without this vital information.</li>
        <li><strong>CHECK Constraints:</strong> Used to enforce domain integrity by limiting the values that can be placed in a column. For example, the `users.role` column has a CHECK constraint to ensure the value is one of the predefined roles ('admin', 'doctor', etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This well-structured database design is crucial for the reliability and consistency of the data managed by the HMS.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 4: SYSTEM DESIGN - PAGE 46 -->
<div class="page">
    <h2>4.3 User Interface (UI) Design</h2>
    
    <p>The user interface is the visual part of the system through which users interact with the application. The primary goal of the UI design for the HMS was to create an interface that is clean, intuitive, and efficient for a diverse set of users who may have varying levels of computer literacy.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Design Principles:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> A consistent layout, color scheme, and set of icons were used throughout the application. The main navigation sidebar is present on all pages, and common actions like "Add New," "Edit," and "Delete" are represented by the same icons and placed in predictable locations. This reduces the cognitive load on users.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> The interface was designed to be uncluttered. Forms have clear labels, and important information is highlighted. Data is presented in well-organized tables with sorting and searching capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The design aims to minimize the number of clicks required to perform common tasks. For example, the dashboard provides quick links to major functions, and forms use auto-completion where possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> The system provides immediate visual feedback for user actions. For example, after submitting a form, a success or error message is displayed. Buttons show a loading state during AJAX requests.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Technology and Frameworks:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bootstrap 5.3.0:</strong> This front-end framework was the cornerstone of the UI design. Its grid system was used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Its pre-styled components (forms, tables, buttons, modals, navbars) were used to build the interface quickly and ensure a professional look and feel.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript/jQuery:</strong> Custom JavaScript was written to handle client-side interactivity. This includes form validation before submission, making asynchronous API calls (AJAX) to fetch or update data without full page reloads, and dynamically updating parts of the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Chart.js:</strong> This library was used on the dashboard and in the reporting module to create visually appealing and easy-to-understand charts and graphs, transforming raw data into actionable insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Font Awesome:</strong> Used for icons, providing clear visual cues for actions and navigation items.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>UI Mockup:</strong> Figure 4.3 shows a mockup of the main dashboard, which is the landing page for most users after logging in. It exemplifies the design principles: a clean layout with a sidebar for navigation, key metrics displayed in "cards" at the top for a quick overview, and charts for visualizing trends. This design provides users with immediate access to the most important information and functions.</p>

    <h1>TESTING</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>Testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle that aims to evaluate the functionality of a software application to ensure it meets the specified requirements. The primary objective of testing is to identify defects, so they can be fixed before the software is deployed. A comprehensive testing strategy was employed for the Hospital Management System, encompassing multiple levels of testing to ensure the system's quality, reliability, and robustness.</p>
    
    <h2>5.1 Testing Strategy</h2>
    
    <p>The testing strategy for the HMS was based on the "Testing Pyramid" model, as illustrated in Figure 5.1. This model advocates for writing tests at different levels of granularity, with a large number of small, fast unit tests at the base, a smaller number of integration tests in the middle, and a very small number of slow, end-to-end system tests at the top.</p>
    
    <p>The strategy involved the following four levels of testing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Focused on testing individual components (PHP classes and methods, JavaScript functions) in isolation.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Focused on verifying the interaction between different modules (e.g., ensuring the Appointment module correctly interacts with the Billing module).</li>
        <li><strong>System Testing:</strong> Tested the complete, integrated system to verify that it meets all the specified requirements from end to end.</li>
        <li><strong>User Acceptance Testing (UAT):</strong> Involved stakeholders (end-users) testing the system to validate that it meets their needs and is ready for deployment.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Testing was performed manually for this project, following structured test cases for each level. A test case is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly. Each test case included a description, steps to reproduce, expected result, and actual result.</p>

<div class="page">
    <h2>5.2 Unit Testing</h2>
    
    <p>Unit testing focuses on the smallest testable parts of the application, which in this project are the individual methods within the PHP classes and standalone JavaScript functions. The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Manual unit tests were conducted by creating simple PHP scripts in the `Testing/` directory to instantiate a class and call its methods with predefined inputs. The output was then compared against the expected result.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Example Unit Test Case: `Validation.php` class</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unit to Test:</strong> `validateEmail()` method.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Case 1: Valid Email</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> `'test@example.com'`</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> `true`</li>
                <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> `true`</li>
                <li><strong>Status:</strong> Pass</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Test Case 2: Invalid Email (missing @)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> `'test.example.com'`</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> `false`</li>
                <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> `false`</li>
                <li><strong>Status:</strong> Pass</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Example Unit Test Case: `Billing.php` class</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unit to Test:</strong> `createBill()` method.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Case 1: Create a bill with valid data</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input:</strong> `patient_id = 1`, `total_amount = 500`, `due_date = '2025-12-10'`</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> The method returns a new bill ID, and a new record is created in the `billing` table with the correct data and a `payment_status` of 'pending'.</li>
                <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> As expected.</li>
                <li><strong>Status:</strong> Pass</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Table 5.1 provides a summary of the unit testing conducted. This process was crucial for catching bugs early in the development cycle, particularly logic errors within the business classes. For instance, unit testing helped identify an issue in the appointment conflict detection logic that was not correctly handling edge cases.</p>

    <h2>5.3 Integration Testing</h2>
    
    <p>Integration testing is performed to expose defects in the interfaces and interactions between integrated components or modules. After the units were tested individually, this phase focused on testing them together to ensure they work correctly as a group.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Integration tests were designed to simulate real-world scenarios that involve multiple modules. For example, completing an appointment should trigger the creation of a bill.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Example Integration Test Scenario: Appointment to Billing Workflow</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modules Involved:</strong> `Appointment`, `Billing`, `AutoBilling`.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario Description:</strong> Test the complete workflow from marking an appointment as 'Completed' to the automatic generation of a bill for the consultation fee.</li>
        <li><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Log in as a Doctor.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the appointments page and select a 'Scheduled' appointment.</li>
                <li>Update the appointment status to 'Completed'.</li>
                <li>Log in as a Receptionist.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the billing page.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> A new bill should be automatically created for the patient associated with the completed appointment. The bill amount should equal the doctor's consultation fee. The bill's payment status should be 'pending'.</li>
        <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> As expected.</li>
        <li><strong>Status:</strong> Pass</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Example Integration Test Scenario: Inventory Deduction on Sale</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modules Involved:</strong> `Billing`, `Inventory`.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario Description:</strong> Test that when a medication is added to a patient's bill, its quantity is correctly deducted from the inventory.</li>
        <li><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Log in as a Pharmacist and check the current stock of 'Paracetamol' (e.g., 100 units).</li>
                <li>Log in as a Receptionist, create a bill for a patient, and add 'Paracetamol' (quantity: 5) as a bill item.</li>
                <li>Log back in as a Pharmacist and check the stock of 'Paracetamol' again.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> The stock level of 'Paracetamol' should now be 95 units.</li>
        <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> As expected.</li>
        <li><strong>Status:</strong> Pass</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Integration testing was vital for uncovering issues related to data flow between modules, API endpoint failures, and incorrect database interactions. For example, an early integration test revealed that the session data was not being correctly passed to the `notifications` module, resulting in notifications not being created for the correct user.</p>

    <h2>5.4 System Testing</h2>
    
    <p>System testing is a level of testing that validates the complete and fully integrated software product. It evaluates the end-to-end functionality of the system as a whole to ensure it conforms to all specified requirements, both functional and non-functional.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> System testing was conducted from the perspective of an end-user. Testers used the live application interface, following test cases based on the use cases defined in the analysis phase. The goal was to simulate real-world usage and test the complete user workflows across the entire application.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Example System Test Case: New Patient Full Cycle</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> A new patient walks in, gets registered, has a consultation, and pays the bill.</li>
        <li><strong>Actors Involved:</strong> Receptionist, Doctor.</li>
        <li><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>(Receptionist) Log in.</li>
                <li>Navigate to 'Patients' and click 'Add New Patient'. Fill in and submit the registration form. <strong>(Verifies Patient Registration)</strong></li>
                <li>Navigate to 'Appointments' and book an appointment for the new patient with a specific doctor. <strong>(Verifies Appointment Booking)</strong></li>
                <li>(Doctor) Log in.</li>
                <li>View the scheduled appointment on the dashboard. Start the consultation and navigate to the patient's medical record.</li>
                <li>Add diagnosis and prescription details. Mark the appointment as 'Completed'. <strong>(Verifies Medical Record and Appointment Status Update)</strong></li>
                <li>(Receptionist) Log in.</li>
                <li>Find the auto-generated bill for the patient's consultation.</li>
                <li>Add a payment for the full amount. <strong>(Verifies Billing and Payment)</strong></li>
                <li>Verify that the bill status is now 'Paid' and the outstanding balance is zero.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Expected Result:</strong> The entire workflow completes successfully without any errors. All data is correctly saved in the database, and the status of all related entities (patient, appointment, bill) is updated correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Actual Result:</strong> An issue was found where the bill was not always generating automatically. This bug in the `AutoBilling` trigger was fixed and retested. After the fix, the workflow completed successfully.</li>
        <li><strong>Status:</strong> Pass (after bug fix).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>System testing also covered non-functional requirements. For example, page load times were measured, the responsiveness of the UI was checked on different devices, and attempts were made to break the system with invalid inputs to test security and error handling.</p>

<div class="page">
    <h2>5.5 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</h2>
    
    <p>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final phase of testing, where the software is tested in the "real world" by the intended audience or business representatives. The main purpose of UAT is not to find bugs, but to validate that the system meets the business requirements and is fit for its intended purpose.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> A small group of stakeholders, including a doctor, a receptionist, and a hospital administrator, were given access to the deployed system. They were asked to perform their regular day-to-day tasks using the HMS over a period of one week. Instead of following rigid test cases, they were encouraged to use the system naturally and provide feedback.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Feedback Collection:</strong> Feedback was collected through informal interviews and a shared feedback document. The feedback was categorized into three types:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bugs:</strong> Actual errors or incorrect behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Change Requests:</strong> Suggestions for improving a feature or workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong> Comments on what they liked about the system.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>Summary of UAT Feedback:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The receptionist praised the intuitive appointment calendar, stating it was "much faster than the old diary."</li>
                <li>The doctor appreciated having the complete patient history available on one screen, calling it a "game-changer for quick decision-making."</li>
                <li>The administrator was impressed with the dashboard and the ability to generate revenue reports instantly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bugs Found:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A minor bug was reported where the date picker was not working correctly on the Safari browser. (Status: Fixed).</li>
                <li>The sorting on the patient table was not working correctly for the 'Date of Birth' column. (Status: Fixed).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Change Requests / Suggestions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The doctor suggested adding a template for common prescriptions to speed up data entry. (Status: Acknowledged, added to 'Future Scope').</li>
                <li>The receptionist requested that the patient search results also show the patient's phone number directly in the list. (Status: Implemented, as it was a minor and useful change).</li>
                <li>The administrator asked for an additional filter on the revenue report to see income by department. (Status: Acknowledged, added to 'Future Scope').</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The UAT phase was extremely valuable. It not only helped in identifying a few final bugs but, more importantly, it confirmed that the system was well-aligned with the users' needs and would provide significant value to the hospital. The positive feedback served as a strong validation of the project's success.</p>

    <h1>CHAPTER 6</h1>
    <h1>SYSTEM SECURITY MEASURES</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>Security is a paramount concern for any software application, but it is especially critical for a Hospital Management System that handles sensitive Patient Health Information (PHI) and financial data. A multi-layered security approach was implemented to protect the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The security measures focused on four key areas: authentication and authorization, data security, protection against common web vulnerabilities, and secure session management.</p>
    
    <h2>6.1 Authentication and Authorization</h2>
    
    <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of determining whether a user has permission to access a specific resource or perform a particular action.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Authentication:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure Password Storage:</strong> User passwords are never stored in plaintext. The system uses PHP's built-in `password_hash()` function to create a strong, salted hash of the user's password using the BCrypt algorithm. When a user logs in, the `password_verify()` function is used to compare the provided password against the stored hash. This makes it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original password even if the database is compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Login Mechanism:</strong> The login process requires a username and password. The system is designed to provide a generic error message ("Invalid username or password") for failed login attempts to prevent attackers from determining whether it was the username or the password that was incorrect (username enumeration).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Authorization (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC):</strong></p>
    <p>Once a user is authenticated, the system uses RBAC to control their access. Each user is assigned one of five roles (`admin`, `doctor`, `nurse`, `receptionist`, `pharmacist`).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Role Definition:</strong> Each role has a specific set of permissions. For example, only an `admin` can access the 'Settings' page, and only a `doctor` or `nurse` can update medical records.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Access control is enforced at two levels:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>UI Level:</strong> The navigation menu and buttons for certain actions are hidden or disabled if the user does not have the required role. For example, the 'Add New User' button is only visible to admins.</li>
                <li><strong>API/Server Level:</strong> This is the most critical enforcement point. Every API endpoint includes a check at the beginning to verify that the logged-in user's role is authorized to perform the requested action. This prevents a user from bypassing the UI restrictions by directly calling an API endpoint. The `Auth.php` class provides a method like `checkRole(['admin', 'doctor'])` for this purpose.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Table 6.1 provides a simplified matrix of the permissions assigned to each role, illustrating the principle of least privilege, where users are only granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 6: SECURITY - PAGE 55 -->
<div class="page">
    <h2>6.2 Data Security</h2>
    
    <p>Data security involves protecting data from unauthorized access and corruption throughout its lifecycle. This includes data in transit (over the network) and data at rest (in the database).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Protection Against SQL Injection:</strong></p>
    <p>SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of attack where a malicious user can interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. The HMS prevents SQLi by exclusively using <strong>prepared statements</strong> with parameterized queries for all database interactions. The application logic uses PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) extension.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Incorrect (Vulnerable) Way:</strong> `$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";`</li>
        <li><strong>Correct (Secure) Way Used in HMS:</strong>
            <div class="code-block">
$stmt = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->execute([$username]);
$user = $stmt->fetch();
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using prepared statements, the database driver is instructed to treat the user-supplied input (`$username`) as data only, not as part of the executable SQL command. This effectively neutralizes any malicious SQL code injected by an attacker.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Protection Against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong></p>
    <p>XSS is an attack where malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. The HMS mitigates XSS by practicing proper output encoding. Whenever user-supplied data is displayed on a web page, it is escaped to ensure that it is rendered as plain text and not interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PHP:</strong> The `htmlspecialchars()` function is used before echoing any data from the database into the HTML. For example: `&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($patient['first_name']); ?&gt;`</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> When dynamically adding content to the page with JavaScript, methods like `.textContent` are preferred over `.innerHTML` to prevent the browser from executing any scripts embedded in the content.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Data in Transit:</strong> While not enforced by the application code itself, it is strongly recommended that the application be deployed with HTTPS. An SSL/TLS certificate encrypts all data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server, protecting it from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
    
    <div class="page-number">55</div>
</div>

<!-- CHAPTER 6: SECURITY - PAGE 56 -->
<div class="page">
    <h2>6.3 Session Management</h2>
    
    <p>Secure session management is crucial for maintaining the authenticated state of a user and preventing unauthorized access to their account.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Session Handling:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Initiation:</strong> A new session is created for a user only after they have been successfully authenticated. Upon login, the system calls `session_regenerate_id(true)` to generate a new, random session ID. This helps to prevent session fixation attacks, where an attacker tricks a user into using a session ID known to the attacker.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Minimal, non-sensitive information is stored in the session variable (`$_SESSION`), such as `user_id`, `username`, and `role`. This data is used to identify the user on subsequent requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Timeout:</strong> The system is configured to automatically expire sessions after a period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes). This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to hijack an abandoned session.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Logout:</strong> The logout functionality properly destroys the session. It unsets all session variables (`session_unset()`), destroys the session data on the server (`session_destroy()`), and clears the session cookie from the browser.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Protection Against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):</strong></p>
    <p>CSRF is an attack that tricks a victim into submitting a malicious request. The HMS implements the synchronizer token pattern to defend against CSRF.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>When a form is loaded, the server generates a unique, random token (CSRF token) and stores it in the user's session.</li>
        <li>This token is also embedded as a hidden field in the form.</li>
        <li>When the user submits the form, the server checks if the token submitted with the form matches the token stored in the session.</li>
        <li>If the tokens do not match, the request is rejected as it is likely a forged request.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This ensures that only requests originating from the application's own forms are processed, thwarting attempts by malicious websites to trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions.</p>
    
    <p>By implementing this comprehensive set of security measures, the Hospital Management System establishes a strong defense against the most common web application threats, safeguarding the integrity of the system and the confidentiality of its data.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 7: COST ESTIMATION - PAGE 57 -->
<div class="page">
    <h1>CHAPTER 7</h1>
    <h1>COST ESTIMATION</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>Cost estimation is the process of forecasting the financial resources needed to complete a project. While this was an academic project with the primary cost being the developer's time, this chapter provides an illustrative cost estimation as if it were a commercial project for a small to medium-sized hospital. This analysis is based on the economic feasibility study conducted in Chapter 3 and breaks down the costs into three main categories: development costs, deployment and infrastructure costs, and maintenance and support costs.</p>
    
    <h2>7.1 Development Costs</h2>
    
    <p>Development costs are the one-time expenses incurred during the creation of the software, from planning to initial deployment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Labor Costs:</strong> This is the most significant component of development cost. It is calculated based on the time spent by the development team.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Manager/Analyst:</strong> Responsible for planning, requirements gathering, and management.
                    <ul><li>Estimated Hours: 80 hours</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Software Developer (Backend/Frontend):</strong> Responsible for design, coding, and unit testing.
                    <ul><li>Estimated Hours: 480 hours</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>QA Tester:</strong> Responsible for system and integration testing.
                    <ul><li>Estimated Hours: 80 hours</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Software and Tools Costs:</strong> For this project, all software used was open-source and free.
            <ul><li>Cost: <strong>$0</strong></li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hardware Costs:</strong> The cost of the computers used for development. This is typically considered part of the company's overhead and not charged directly to a single project.
            <ul><li>Cost: <strong>$0</strong> (for this analysis)</li></ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Total Estimated Development Cost:</strong></p>
    <p>To calculate the total labor cost, we can use hypothetical hourly rates. Assuming a blended rate for a small, cost-effective development team:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total Hours: 80 (PM) + 480 (Dev) + 80 (QA) = 640 hours</li>
        <li>Hypothetical Blended Rate: $35/hour</li>
        <li><strong>Total Development Cost = 640 hours * $35/hour = $22,400</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This one-time cost represents the initial investment to build the software.</p>
    
    <div class="page-number">57</div>
</div>

<!-- CHAPTER 7: COST ESTIMATION - PAGE 58 -->
<div class="page">
    <h2>7.2 Deployment and Infrastructure Costs</h2>
    
    <p>These are the recurring costs associated with hosting the application and making it available to users.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server Hosting:</strong> The cost of renting a server from a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode). A basic Virtual Private Server (VPS) suitable for this application would be sufficient for a small hospital.
            <ul><li>Estimated Cost: <strong>$15 - $30 per month</strong></li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> The cost of registering a domain name for the application (e.g., `myhospital.com`).
            <ul><li>Estimated Cost: <strong>$15 per year</strong></li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>SSL Certificate:</strong> Required for enabling HTTPS to secure data in transit. Free SSL certificates are available from providers like Let's Encrypt.
            <ul><li>Cost: <strong>$0</strong></li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Email Service:</strong> Cost for a transactional email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) to reliably send appointment reminders and other notifications. Many services have a free tier that would likely be sufficient initially.
            <ul><li>Estimated Cost: <strong>$0 - $10 per month</strong> (depending on volume)</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Backup Storage:</strong> Cost for storing database backups off-site (e.g., in Amazon S3).
            <ul><li>Estimated Cost: <strong>$5 per month</strong></li></ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Total Estimated Annual Infrastructure Cost:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server: $20/month * 12 = $240</li>
        <li>Domain: $15</li>
        <li>Email: $5/month * 12 = $60</li>
        <li>Backup: $5/month * 12 = $60</li>
        <li><strong>Total Annual Cost ≈ $375</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>7.3 Maintenance and Support Costs</h2>
    
    <p>These are the ongoing costs to keep the system running smoothly after deployment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Support:</strong> Providing support to end-users and troubleshooting issues.
            <ul><li>Estimated Effort: 5 hours per month</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Fixing any defects discovered after deployment.
            <ul><li>Estimated Effort: 5 hours per month</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Software Updates:</strong> Applying security patches and updates to the underlying software (OS, PHP, web server).
            <ul><li>Estimated Effort: 2 hours per month</li></ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Total Estimated Annual Maintenance Cost:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total Hours: (5 + 5 + 2) hours/month * 12 months = 144 hours per year</li>
        <li>Using the same blended rate of $35/hour:</li>
        <li><strong>Total Annual Maintenance Cost = 144 hours * $35/hour = $5,040</strong></li>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
    <p>The analysis shows that the primary cost is the upfront development investment in the first year. The recurring costs in subsequent years are significantly lower, covering hosting and routine maintenance. When compared with the tangible benefits identified in the economic feasibility study (estimated at over $18,000 annually), the project demonstrates a strong return on investment. The initial development cost is recovered within the first two years of operation.</p>
    
    <p>This cost structure makes a custom-built system like this HMS an attractive option for small to medium-sized hospitals, as it avoids the high recurring licensing fees often associated with commercial off-the-shelf software, offering a lower total cost of ownership over the long term.</p>

    <h1>CHAPTER 8</h1>
    <h1>REPORT</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>This chapter provides a summary of the project's implementation, discusses the challenges encountered during development, highlights the key features delivered, and reflects on the overall performance of the system. It serves as a concluding overview of the development journey and the final product.</p>
    
    <h2>8.1 Implementation Summary</h2>
    
    <p>The Hospital Management System was successfully implemented following the design specifications outlined in Chapter 4. The project resulted in a fully functional, web-based application that addresses the core requirements of a small to medium-sized healthcare facility.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> PHP 8.2.12, with an object-oriented architecture comprising 18 distinct classes to manage different business domains.</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> SQLite 3, with a normalized schema of 15 tables enforcing data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap 5.3.0 for responsive design and Chart.js for data visualization.</li>
        <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> A three-tier client-server model with a clear separation between the presentation (UI), logic (PHP classes), and data (SQLite) layers. RESTful principles were followed for the API design.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Project Statistics:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lines of Code:</strong> Over 16,000 lines of PHP code and over 5,000 lines of JavaScript code.</li>
        <li><strong>Number of Files:</strong> The project consists of 135 source code files (PHP, JS, SQL).</li>
        <li><strong>Development Timeline:</strong> The project was completed over a period of 26 weeks, adhering to the schedule defined in the Gantt chart.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The implementation process was iterative. Core modules like Authentication, Patient Management, and Appointments were developed first to establish a solid foundation. Subsequent modules like Billing, Inventory, and Reporting were then built on top of this core. This modular approach allowed for focused development and testing of each component before integrating it into the larger system. The use of Git for version control was instrumental in managing code changes, tracking issues, and maintaining a stable codebase throughout the project.</p>

    <h2>8.2 Challenges Faced and Solutions</h2>
    
    <p>No project is without its challenges. The development of the HMS encountered several technical and logistical hurdles, which provided valuable learning experiences.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Challenge 1: Preventing Appointment Conflicts</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> The initial logic for checking doctor availability was complex. It needed to account for the doctor's general schedule (e.g., Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm), existing appointments, and breaks. A simple check for an exact time match was insufficient as appointments have durations.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> A more robust conflict detection algorithm was developed. When checking for a new appointment (e.g., 10:00 AM for 30 minutes), the query now checks for any existing appointments for that doctor that overlap with the proposed time slot [10:00 AM, 10:30 AM). This involved careful SQL querying with time-based comparisons.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Challenge 2: Handling Multiple Currencies</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Displaying monetary values consistently across the application with the correct currency symbol and formatting was challenging. Hardcoding the currency symbol was not a scalable solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> A dedicated `Currency.php` class was created. This class reads the default currency from the system settings. It provides a `format()` method that takes a numeric value and returns a string formatted with the correct currency symbol, thousands separator, and decimal points. All monetary values displayed in the UI are passed through this method, ensuring consistency and making it easy to change the currency globally.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Challenge 3: Ensuring Security Across All Endpoints</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> With numerous API endpoints, it was crucial to ensure that role-based access control was consistently applied everywhere to prevent unauthorized access. It was easy to forget to add a security check to a new endpoint.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> A standardized structure was adopted for all API files. A central `auth_helper.php` file was created, which included a function to check the user's session and role. Every API script begins by including this helper and calling the authorization function, passing the roles allowed for that endpoint (e.g., `require_auth(['admin'])`). This made the security check a mandatory first step for every request.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Challenge 4: Generating PDF Reports</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Generating complex, multi-page PDF reports with tables and charts from PHP can be difficult. The layout needs to be precisely controlled.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> An external library (like FPDF or TCPDF, represented by the `PDFReport.php` class) was integrated. While this added a dependency, it abstracted away the complexities of the PDF file format. The solution involved creating a class that extended the library's base class, allowing for the creation of custom headers, footers, and table-rendering methods tailored to the HMS reports.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8.4 System Performance</h2>
    
    <p>During system testing, non-functional requirements related to performance were evaluated.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Page Load Times:</strong> On the test server with a standard broadband connection, average page load times were between 1.5 and 2.5 seconds, well within the 3-second target.</li>
        <li><strong>Query Performance:</strong> Database queries for searching patients or fetching appointment lists consistently returned results in under 1 second, even as the database was populated with thousands of test records. The use of indexes on frequently searched columns (like `patient_id`, `first_name`, `appointment_date`) was key to this performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> The system was tested with a load testing tool simulating up to 30 concurrent users. The application remained responsive with no significant increase in response times, suggesting it is well-equipped to handle the load of a small to medium-sized hospital.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Overall, the project successfully transitioned from a set of requirements to a robust, secure, and performant application that provides tangible benefits to its users.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER 9: FUTURE SCOPE - PAGE 63 -->
<div class="page">
    <h1>CHAPTER 9</h1>
    <h1>FUTURE SCOPE</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>While the current version of the Hospital Management System provides a comprehensive set of features for managing a healthcare facility, there are numerous opportunities for future enhancements that could further increase its value and capabilities. This chapter outlines several potential directions for the future development of the HMS.</p>
    
    <h2>9.1 Mobile Application Development</h2>
    
    <p>Although the current web application is responsive, dedicated native mobile applications for iOS and Android could offer a superior user experience and additional functionality.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Patient App:</strong> A mobile app for patients could allow them to book and manage their appointments, view their medical records and lab results, receive appointment reminders and health tips via push notifications, make payments, and conduct telemedicine sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Doctor/Staff App:</strong> A mobile app for doctors and other staff would enable them to manage their schedules, access patient records, and receive urgent notifications on the go, untethering them from desktop workstations. It could also leverage device features like the camera for uploading clinical photos.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>9.2 AI and Machine Learning Integration</h2>
    
    <p>The current AI Assistant is a basic, rule-based system. This could be significantly enhanced by integrating advanced AI and machine learning models.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Machine learning models could be trained on patient data to predict disease outbreaks in the community, identify patients at high risk for certain conditions, or predict appointment no-shows to allow for overbooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinical Decision Support:</strong> An AI system could assist doctors by providing diagnostic suggestions based on symptoms and patient history, recommending treatment plans based on clinical guidelines, and flagging potential adverse drug interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Medical Coding:</strong> Natural Language Processing (NLP) could be used to analyze doctors' notes and automatically suggest the appropriate medical codes (like ICD-10) for billing and insurance purposes, reducing administrative work.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>9.3 IoT and Wearable Device Integration</h2>
    
    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) offers exciting possibilities for automating data collection and monitoring patients remotely.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wearable Integration:</strong> The HMS could integrate with patient-owned wearable devices (like smartwatches) to automatically pull in data on vital signs, activity levels, and sleep patterns, providing doctors with a more holistic view of a patient's health.</li>
        <li><strong>In-Hospital IoT:</strong> IoT sensors could be used to track the location of critical mobile equipment (like wheelchairs and infusion pumps), monitor the temperature of refrigerators storing vaccines, or automatically record data from bedside patient monitors into the EHR.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="page-number">63</div>
</div>

<!-- CHAPTER 9: FUTURE SCOPE - PAGE 64 -->
<div class="page">
    <h2>9.4 Enhanced Interoperability</h2>
    
    <p>To be a part of the broader healthcare ecosystem, the HMS needs to be able to communicate with other systems.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FHIR/HL7 Compliance:</strong> The system could be updated to support healthcare interoperability standards like FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) or HL7 (Health Level Seven). This would allow it to securely exchange data with other hospitals, laboratories, pharmacies, and national health record systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with Insurance Providers:</strong> Developing direct API integrations with insurance companies could automate the process of eligibility checks and claim submissions, speeding up the revenue cycle.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>9.5 Advanced Pharmacy Module</h2>
    
    <p>The current inventory module could be expanded into a full-fledged pharmacy management system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>E-Prescribing:</strong> Allow doctors to send prescriptions directly to the pharmacy module electronically.</li>
        <li><strong>Drug Interaction Checking:</strong> Integrate a drug database to automatically check for potential interactions between medications in a patient's prescription.</li>
        <li><strong>Dispensation Workflow:</strong> Manage the entire workflow of dispensing medication, including label printing and patient counseling notes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>9.6 Cloud Migration and Scalability</h2>
    
    <p>For larger hospitals or chains of clinics, the system could be migrated to a more robust cloud architecture.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Database Scaling:</strong> Migrating from SQLite to a more powerful client-server database like PostgreSQL or MySQL would be necessary to handle higher transaction volumes.</li>
        <li><strong>Microservices Architecture:</strong> The application could be re-architected from a monolith into a set of microservices (e.g., a separate service for patients, appointments, billing). This would allow for independent scaling of different parts of the application and improve resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Serverless Functions:</strong> Certain tasks, like sending notifications or processing images, could be offloaded to serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) to improve performance and reduce server load.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These future enhancements demonstrate that the current HMS provides a solid foundation upon which a much more powerful and intelligent healthcare platform can be built, adapting to the evolving technological landscape and the growing needs of the healthcare industry.</p>

    <br>
    
    <h2>10.1 Code Samples</h2>
    
    <p>This section provides representative code samples from key parts of the application to illustrate the implementation techniques used.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sample 1: Prepared Statement in `Auth.php` (Login Method)</strong></p>
    <p>This snippet shows the secure method used to fetch a user and verify their password, preventing SQL injection and using hashed password verification.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
public function login($username, $password) {
    $stmt = $this->db->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
    $stmt->execute([$username]);
    $user = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

    if ($user && password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {
        // Password is correct, start session
        session_regenerate_id(true);
        $_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];
        $_SESSION['username'] = $user['username'];
        $_SESSION['role'] = $user['role'];
        return true;
    } else {
        // Invalid credentials
        return false;
    }
}
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Sample 2: Role-Based Access Control in `api/users.php`</strong></p>
    <p>This shows how every API endpoint is protected by first checking the user's role.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
require_once '../config/bootstrap.php';
require_once '../classes/Auth.php';

$auth = new Auth($db);

// This line enforces the security policy
$auth->requireAuth(['admin']);

// ... rest of the API code to manage users ...
